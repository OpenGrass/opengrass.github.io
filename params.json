{"name":"OpenGrass","tagline":"An open-source Ingress","body":"# The OpenGrass Project\r\nThe OpenGrass Project aims to provide an alternative to Google's showcase augmented-reality game Ingress. As the actual Ingress is more a of an overblown prove-of-concept and technology showcase as an actual game, we try to make the best, free, and most-joyful ingress concept available to anyone.\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\nInstead of relying on Google's authentication and sso services, we use OpenID to distinguish users. There are lots and lots of OpenID providers, like Google, Facebook or OpenID.net. And OpenID isn't related to a specific provider by definition, you can choose your own, like your wordpress blog, which has an OpenID account built-in, or an account hosted at google for instance.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Map\r\nInstead of relying on Google's Maps and Map Engine, OpenGrass utilizes OpenStreetMap, an open-source alternative to Google Maps and its' related technologies, like the Maps JS Api. Instead, OpenGrass uses OpenStreetMap with a customized map layout, upon the OpenLayers technology as provided by the OpenStreetMap initiative.\r\n\r\n## Data Storage\r\nIn Ingress, all game-related data is stored in Google's App Engine, a platform created and operated by Google which allows companies to quickly build apps and store the date processed by them. In OpenGrass, we really don't like the idea of our data being bound to one data storage. That's why OpenGrass allows you to \"hook onto\" several \"storages\", which store either the game, or your game-play.\r\n\r\n### Game Storage\r\nBy \"Game Storage\", amongst details, the list of portals in the world is meant. This list determines the game layout, determined by portals of various strengths, and the detailled *Game Progress* information, which tells the players' client how to add / subtract AP, XM, XMP and other object-specific properties.\r\n\r\n### GamePlay Storage\r\nThe \"GamePlay\" storage is player-specific, and is hosted on a provider as determined by the player. This storage can only be written by **ONLY THE APP, not the owning user directly**, but is allowed to be read by any other user.\r\nThis allows for gameplay to be hosted distributed, not manageable by one entity.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
